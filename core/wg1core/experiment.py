"""Experiment files (../../schemas/experiments.md): loading one, and what its validator cannot say about it.

`problems(experiment, folder, results_schema, anchors)` returns everything wrong with an experiment, the validator's
errors first: missing or misnamed files, hashes that differ, a request file for another member, checks naming
undeclared members or levels, a check against the reference for a member that pins none or whose reference states no
error the check needs, a metric that is neither the core's nor defined by the experiment, a metric's function that is
missing or changed, quantities the model's results schema does not define, missing report scripts, and anchors the
model's source page does not have. The results schema and the anchors are the model repository's, named in its
registry file; the runner calls this before it runs anything.

A solution has a kind and a role. Its kind is how it is obtained: `exact`, evaluated from a closed form, or
`numerical`, approximated by a method with settings at a level. Its role is what it is for in an experiment: the
`reference`, which a member pins with its stated errors, or an `entry`, a registered toolkit's solution measured
against it. `stated_error` reads what a reference states.
